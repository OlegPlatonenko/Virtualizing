## API Primitives

- Persistent entries in the k8s system
- Uses these to represent state of the cluster
- Describe:
    1. What applications are running
    2. Which nodes those apps are running on
    3. Policies around those apps
- Kubernetes objects are "recors of intent"

-------------------------------------------------------
- Object spec
- Object status

## Common K8S Objects

- **Nodes** - hosts which make up cluster
- **Pods** - single instances of app containers
- **Deployments** - load balanced sets of pods
- **Services** - expose deployments to external networks
- **ConfigMaps** - key walue pairs

## Names and UIDs

Names:
- All objects have a unique name
- Client provided
- Can be reused
- Max length 253 char.
- Lower case alphanumeric charact.
- and . allowed

UIDs
- All objects have a unique UID
- Generated by k8s
- Spatially and temporally unique

## Namespaces

- Multiple virtual clusters back by the same physical cluster
- Generally for large deployments
- provide scope of names
- Easy way to divide cluster resources
- Allows for multiple teams of users
- Aloows for resource quotas
- Special "kube-system" namespace

## Nodes

- VM or physical machine
- Services necessary to run pods
- Managed by the master
- Services necessary:
    1. **Container runtime** - like Docker
    2. **Kubelet** - orchestrates the containers in local node
    3. **Kube-proxy** - handles networking
- Not inherently created by k8s, but by Cloud Provider
- Kubernetes checks the node for validity

## Cloud Controller Managers

- Route controller
- Service Controller
- PersistentVolumeLabels controller

## Node Controller

- Assign CIDR block to a newly registered node
- Keeps track of the nodes
- Monitors the node health
- Evicts pods from unhealthy nodes
- Can taint nodes based on current conditions in more recent versions

## Kubernetes Services and Network Primitives

- Underlying Architecture
- Pod -- Simplest Cubernetes object
- Ephemereal
- Usually Managed via Deployments

----------------------------------------

Kubernetes services:
- Deployment specification
- Image
- Number of replicas

- Services --> Deployments
- Particular port or IP address
